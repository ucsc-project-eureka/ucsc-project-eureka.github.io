Eureka-Backend

Eureka Risk Assessment Front-End:

EUREKA is a wildfire detection network that aims to develop and deploy a large-scale IoT network consisting of miniature weather stations capable of monitoring various environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity, wind, soil moisture) to help predict and detect wildfires in a timely manner and mitigate their potentially devastating consequences.

This repository is connected to a current priavet repository with the codebase in typescript, react.js, and css. Within that other components of our backend are attached and will not be avaliable till our research is publishes. The packages from previous systems are in R this will be able to run locally hopefully with a python/node and postgres bakcend!
